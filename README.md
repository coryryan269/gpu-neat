# gpu-neat
An implementation of the NEAT algorithm that takes advantage of TensorFlow's GPU capabilities

## About
This is a personal project made to implement one of my favorite machine learning algorithms of all time: Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies. The existing implementation at [neat-python](https://github.com/CodeReclaimers/neat-python) is a great project, but it's lacking the ability to use GPUs.

This project is not meant to compete with neat-python, I just thought it would be fun to reproduce results from one of my favorite ML papers of all time.
